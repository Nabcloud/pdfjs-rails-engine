This gem integrate Mozilla's awesome PDF.jS javascript library to your Rails project. Here is the original pdf.js repo: https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/

NOTE: This is not yet optimized. Only experimental. Only works with pdfs stored in your rails app.

Instructions:

1 Add this to your GEMFILE:
  gem 'pdfjs-rails-engine', github: "normancapule/pdfjs-rails-engine"
2 Mount the Gem's routes to your routes (routeception):
  mount PdfjsRailsEngine::Engine
3 View your pdfs in the viewer with this url pattern:
  /#{your-path-to-the-pdf-viewer}?file=/PDF.pdf

To do:
  Add l10n resources of the pdf.js repo
  Minify all the js libraries (Only pdf.js and pdf.worker.js are minified)
  Allow pdf viewer to access remote urls
